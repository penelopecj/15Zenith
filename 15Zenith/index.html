            <p>Dear Residents,</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit this page, which we hope clarifies the current fire safety situation at <strong>15 Zenith Close</strong>.  To date, the information from <a href="https://www.nhg.org.uk/" target="_blank" id="costs">Notting Hill Genesis</a> has been confusing, inconsistent and unclear, so we hope to clarify the real situation below.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content costs">
            <h2>Potental Costs</h2>
            <p>We are currently facing <u>huge personal costs</u> for remediation of the building.   By now you should have received cost information from Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) via Section 20 notices.</p>  
            <p>When costs per leaseholder exceed £250 per year for building work or £100 per year for services, NHG then needs to inform you of this, which is what these notices are for. <strong>The actual costs involved are however much, much higher:</strong></p>

                <figcaption>Does this make you feel safe?</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p style="margin: 2rem 0 .2rem " class="bold">COST OF NEW FIRE ALARM</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0" class="bold urgent">£83,632 (£1,115 per flat)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: .2rem" class="bold">COST OF WAKING WATCH*</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0" class="bold urgent">£102,805 (£1,370 per flat)</p>
                    <p>*<em>This is only the waking watch cost for July and August.  The cost of the waking watch per flat is actually £685 each month.  If the waking watch continues at its current rate the cost would be <span class="urgent">£8,220 per flat</span> on average over the next year.</em></p>
                    <p>Notting Hill Genesis have previously stated that the “the waking watch can be relieved of their position” upon installing the new fire alarm.  They are now however stating that this will only <em>reduce</em> the ongoing costs associated, which means they intend the waking watch is here to stay - we will dispute this.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="margin-top: 2rem" class="bold">OTHER COSTS</p>
                    <p>There are <strong>further costs</strong> that will rise over the next year which NHG have not yet mentioned, such as the insurance cost for the building.  If all these costs are passed on, it could be over <span class="urgent">£10,000 extra</span> on your service charge per year until the building is fixed, which may take around 4 years.</p>
                    <p>To add insult to injury, if the cost of fixing the building is passed on to residents, this will potentially cost us all a further <span class="urgent">£25,000+ per flat</span>.  Negotiations with Hill on this are ongoing.</p>
                    <p id="faq">People in larger flats will of course pay even more as we have simply taken the average cost per flat based on the 75 flats in the block to demonstrate the numbers.</p>

        <section class="content faq">
            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0">This is outrageous – can I withhold my service charge?</h3>
            <p>The short answer is no.  Under our leases, Notting Hill Genesis is able to pass these costs on to residents.  If you withhold payment of your service charge, you will be in breach of your lease and Notting Hill Genesis could evict you from your home, send in bailiffs, or put a debt against your property for the amount outstanding.</p>
            <h3>Are these costs definitely being passed on?</h3>
            <p>Notting Hill Genesis have previously stated that they will only pass on these costs as a last resort if they cannot be charged back to the developer or covered by insurance.  However, their latest correspondence sent on 24th July (see image to left) makes it clear that they are intending on passing these costs down in the service charge.</p>
            <p>Realistically there will not be any agreement about costs with Hill (the developer) or the insurers reached for a number of years, during which time residents may well end up covering these.</p>
            <h3>Why are we in this situation?</h3>
            <p>Post-Grenfell, there are now requirements for high-rise buildings (above 18m tall) to be inspected to confirm they are built properly to withstand fire.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/cladding.jpg" alt="Terracotta-tile cladding">
                <figcaption>Zenith's terracotta-tile cladding</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>15 Zenith Close is not made from flammable material (the exterior is terracotta tiles) and should have passed any inspection without question.  However, when 15 Zenith Close was recently inspected, the inspectors found that our building was built with incorrectly installed cavity barriers in some places and totally missing cavity barriers in others behind the exterior cladding.  These are crucial parts which stop the spread of fire.</p>
            <p>To have built the building in this way, would never have been compliant when the building was finished 6 years ago, and would never have been the agreed design.  It is a very clear defect by the developer (Hill), and a scandal at every level that this was able to happen and initially passed inspection.</p>
            <h3>Shouldn’t the developer pay for this?</h3>
            <p>This appears to be a clear-cut case of developer fault.  However, Hill (the developer) are arguing as hard as they can to get off the hook for fixing the building in any way they can.  Hill is even trying to dispute how tall some of the buildings actually are.</p>
            <p>There is therefore a chance that we may end up having to pay to fix their improper construction, even though 15 Zenith Close should still be under warranty and the case looks open and shut for who’s fault this is.</p>
            <p>For the avoidance of any doubt, Hill built Zenith Close under a design & build contract, which would have left them responsible for the design of the building, the construction of the building, and the quality control and compliance of the building.  Hill was the contractor, the designer and the quality control.  This matter begins and ends with Hill.</p>
            <h3>For how long will we be in this situation?</h3>
            <p>Negotiations with the developer (Hill) are expected to take around a year – as mentioned above Hill will be as difficult as possible however clear cut the situation.  Organising the potential work needed will take a further 18 months, and then carrying out the work will take another year.  Therefore, we will be in this situation for at least 3-4 years.</p>
            <h3>Can I move?</h3>
            <p>The short answer is no.  Until the building is fixed, banks will not provide new mortgages on it for any future buyers.  The EWS form that Notting Hill Genesis has sent us, only confirms that the building has failed its inspection, and by NHG’s own admission will not be satisfactory for any lenders to lend on the building.</p>
            <p>You are unlikely to be able to swap to a buy-to-let mortgage. This would require a new valuation, which will value the flat at nothing for now.  You may be able to get consent-to-let from your bank, but this is at your bank’s discretion and multiple banks have already rejected applications from residents of 15 Zenith Close.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, we are all mortgage prisoners of the building, and on the line for significant costs as things stand.</p>
            <h3>So what can we do?</h3>
            <p>We have until 20th August to dispute the continued use of the waking watch, for which we will need to engage the services of relevant professional experts (lawyers, surveyors, fire engineers).</p>
            <p>Residents need representation from their own professional experts to fight being passed any costs and to push for a quick resolution.  Without this we are sitting ducks, waiting to be passed the cost and relying on NHG to fight hard for us, which is not a good strategy.</p>
            <p>To be able to get experts involved and fight our case, we need you to contribute what you can towards the <strong style="color: #10df7e">15 Zenith Fund</strong>. We will need a few hundred pounds per flat as a starting point.  This may sound steep but relative to the ongoing cost of the waking watch (almost £700 per month for each of us!) the costs to fight this are very small.  The cost of the actual repair bill for the building for reference would be £25,000 plus per flat, so to spend a few hundred pounds at this point to avoid this and to show we are serious in fighting will be worth it.</p>
            <p class="bold">Please give as generously as you can, but if every one of the 75 flats in Block 15 donated £200 we would have £15,000 to properly represent ourselves.</p>
            <p>The Residents Association will fight for you and keep you updated, but we need your help to do so – <strong>the link to our GoFundMe is below:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Developed by <a href="https://www.hill.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hill</a> in 2014 and owned by Freeholder <a href="https://www.nhg.org.uk/" target="_blank">Notting Hill Genesis</a>', 15 Zenith Close is one of thousands of buildings across the UK that are blighted by fire safety concerns following the Grenfell Tragedy in 2017.</strong></Developed></p>
        <p>Unlike many buildings, 15 Zenith is not made from combustible material, but has instead been found to have been constructed inadequately to meet the required standards for fire protection.</p>
        <p>This has left residents trapped as prisoners, unable to sell their flats, which banks will no longer lend on, and forced into paying thousands of pounds each for safety measures such as 'waking watch' patrols until the building can be made safe.  Lives are on hold, families broken, and crippling costs accumulating, whilst there is a lack of action and responsibility from those who built and profited from the building, despite the inadequacies of its construction just 6 years ago.</p>
        <p>Residents have fought an uphill battle for information, and we set out a timeline of the current events and lack of progress below, along with residents' stories to show the human side to this very national problem.</p>
        <section id="updates"></section>
        <p><u>15 Zenith is just one building, but there are 75 families living under its shadow, and thousands of other buildings and families out there just like this.</u></p>

            <p class="p11">As a chartered surveyor and property investment manager, Zac works with building developments like Zenith Close all the time. Zac has recently gotten engaged to Penny, a web developer from NYC. The two of them are looking forward to getting married and moving into a proper house to start their new life together. However, they are unable to make any plans for their future so long as the potentially crippling costs of the building repairs hang over them.</p>
